# LibCrypto

**Cryptographic library for Java and JavaScript**

## Overview

`libcrypto` is a versatile cryptographic library designed to provide easy-to-use implementations of advanced cryptographic algorithms for both Java and JavaScript environments. The library focuses on three key cryptographic primitives: AES GCM for symmetric encryption, Argon2 for key derivation, and X25519 for elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

### Features

- **AES GCM Encryption**
    - Secure and efficient symmetric encryption using the AES block cipher in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) mode.
- **Argon2 Key Derivation**
    - A memory-hard key derivation function that provides resistance against both brute-force and side-channel attacks.
- **X25519 Key Exchange**
    - Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange for a secure key establishment in a public-key cryptography setting.
